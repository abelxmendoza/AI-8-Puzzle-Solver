# A.I. 8-Puzzle Solver

Welcome to the AI 8-Puzzle Solver repository. This project is a Python implementation of an 8-puzzle solver that uses the hill-climbing search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The 8-puzzle is a classic problem in artificial intelligence, and this solver demonstrates how to find a solution by iteratively optimizing the state using the chosen heuristic.

## Getting Started

To use this solver, you'll need Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-8-Puzzle-Solver.git
```

1. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd AI-8-Puzzle-Solver
```

3. Run the solver:

```bash
python3 8puzzle.py
```


The solver will attempt to find a solution to the 8-puzzle problem using the hill-climbing algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic.

## Repository Structure

* `8puzzle.py`: The Python script containing the hill-climbing search implementation.
* `README.md`: This file providing information about the repository.
* Other files: You can include additional files and documentation as needed for your project.

## Customization

You can customize this solver and adapt it to your specific requirements. Here are some ways to extend the project:

* Implement additional search algorithms.
* Allow users to provide their own initial and goal states.
* Improve the user interface for input and output.
